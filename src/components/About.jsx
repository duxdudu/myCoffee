            What Make Our Coffee Special
          </h2>
          <p className="my-3" >
            The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about specialty
            coffee is its advanced quality. The flavors hidden in a cup of
            coffee are rich and crisp, and this comes not just from the quality
            of the specialty coffee beans, but from the work ethic and
            dedication put into it by the farmer.
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            Coffee has always been a part of peopleâ€™s life since time
            immemorial. Whether you nurse a cup of java in the morning or sip a
            coffee latte frappe in the evening, it can make a world of
            difference. Not only does the caffeine make you alive and kicking,
            but it also has various health benefits
